This persisten backdoor will open a server to listen for connections on target machine and persist it's listening features even after attacker disconnects or closes the initial session.
It will automatically send it's IP address to a web server (simple web server), where the attacker can retrieve IP addresses of infected targets to choose to connect with.
This is a bindshell method, so that the target remains listening for connections.
