This persistent backdoor will launch a server and listen for connections on target machine, it will persist it's listening features even after attacker disconnects or closes the initial session.
It will automatically send it's IP address to a web server (simple web server), where the attacker can retrieve IP addresses of infected targets to choose to connect with.
This is a bindshell method, so that the target remains listening for connections.
